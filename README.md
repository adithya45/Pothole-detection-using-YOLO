# Pothole Detection using YOLO and OpenCV

## 🚀 Overview
This project implements a real-time pothole detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection. It is designed to identify potholes in video feeds, making road safety monitoring more efficient.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **YOLOv4/YOLOR**: Deep learning model for object detection.
- **OpenCV**: Image processing and video handling.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Model loading (if applicable).
- **Streamlit**: Web-based interface for real-time detection.
- **Flask (Optional)**: Backend API for hosting the model.
- **Docker**: For containerization and deployment.
- **GitHub Actions**: CI/CD for automated deployment.

## 🔧 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pothole-detection.git
cd pothole-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🎯 Usage
### Running the Detection Script
```bash
python app.py
```
For real-time detection via a webcam, run:
```bash
python app.py --webcam
```

## 🖥️ Deployment
### Deploying on Streamlit Cloud
1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. Go to [Streamlit Share](https://share.streamlit.io/) and connect your repo.
3. Set up dependencies using `requirements.txt`.
4. Deploy and share the link!

### Deploying with Docker
```bash
docker build -t pothole-detection .
docker run -p 8501:8501 pothole-detection
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Improve accuracy using custom-trained YOLO models.
- Deploy as a mobile application.
- Integrate GPS tracking for detected potholes.
